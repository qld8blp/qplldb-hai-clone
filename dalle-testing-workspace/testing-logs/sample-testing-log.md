## Overall Notes

### What Worked Well:
- Specific color descriptions (FANUC orange/white)
- "Professional photography" in prompts improved quality
- Industrial lighting terms produced realistic results
- Equipment-specific terminology helped accuracy

### Areas for Improvement:
- Factory scenes need more thermal spray specific equipment
- Consider adding more specific brand elements
- Some backgrounds could be more detailed

### Recommendations for Next Session:
1. Test HAI_POWDER_001 and HAI_WIRE_001 for product pages
2. Refine factory prompts with more specific equipment
3. Try variations with different lighting conditions
4. Test process images for technical documentation

### Prompt Modifications Made:
- Added "4K quality" to improve resolution
- Specified "bright industrial lighting" for better visibility
- Included "realistic lighting and shadows" for more natural appearance

### Images Ready for Website:
- ✅ fanuc_spray_process_001.png (Hero section candidate)
