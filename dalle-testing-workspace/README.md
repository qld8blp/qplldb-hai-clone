## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Make setup script executable and run
chmod +x setup-workspace.sh
./setup-workspace.sh
```

### 2. Review Testing Materials
- Read `TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for complete workflow
- Review `dalle-prompts-collection.md` for all available prompts
- Check `testing-logs/sample-testing-log.md` for documentation format

### 3. Start Testing (Priority Order)
1. **FANUC Robot Prompts** (FANUC_001 through FANUC_005)
2. **Core Products** (HAI_EQUIP_001, HAI_POWDER_001, HAI_WIRE_001, HAI_PARTS_001)
3. **Facilities & Processes** (HAI_FACTORY_001, HAI_QC_001, HAI_PROCESS_001)

## 📋 Testing Workflow

1. **Select prompt** from collection
2. **Generate image** using DALL-E 3
3. **Evaluate quality** (1-5 scale)
4. **Save with proper filename** in designated directory
5. **Document results** in testing log
6. **Iterate if needed** with prompt modifications
